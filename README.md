# About "AUTOCARE-Car-Service-Booking-System"
This business project aims to develop a database-driven online booking system for a local car service center called AutoCare. 
This business project was completed to fulfill the requirement of NCC Education's L5DCBM class.

This project is focused on addressing and solving problems faced by AutoCare, such as insufficient garage space, long queueing times, dissatisfaction with services, and a paper-based system that hampers productivity.

The proposed system scope includes implementations where customers can book various car services offered by AutoCare. 

The proposed system will allow customers to create user accounts, register their vehicles, book service appointments, choose the type of payment, track the progress of their services, and provide feedback and ratings. 

Additionally, the system will include administration functions for managing bookings, customer and vehicle information, services, and service ratings.

By implementing the proposed system, AutoCare aims to reduce queueing and waiting times, improve service quality and customer satisfaction, streamline booking management, and expand its services to more areas. 

# Project Process
First and foremost, I started with Project Proposal. For project proposal, the background of AUTOCARE,their current process, current problems, Proposed system for current problems, Aims and objects of project, project management planning (including Gantt Charts, Milestone planning, Work Breakdown Structure, Progress Management, Risk management) were planned out first. 

Secondly, necessary literature reviews about Databases are documented, comparing and chooseing a suitable RDBMS was done, and suitable methodologies were compared and chosen. Then, case studies on business with similar problems were performed. 

Thirdly, once necessary RDBMS and methodologies were chosen, Feasibility analysis on Social, Technical, Cost-Benefit were done and decided No-GO, GO decisions. 

Once Go decision was permitted, database was designed and implemented from Conceptual to Physical stages, quries neessary for reports are written and Data Dictionary was provided. 

Lastly, Low to High fidelity prototypes were designed. As low fidelity protoypes are drafted on paper, its images will not be included here, instead high fidelity designs done in Figma will be shown in Exported Ui folder.

Once necessary database with essential reports and prototypes were firstly designed for our proposed system, the overall project was evaluated with related stakeholers with matrixes and necessary changes were made.
The project was concluded by completing Client Evaluation and Achievement checklist.

# To get started with viewing
In Database folder, there will be MSSQL related .ldf and .mdf files, which you can import into your MSSQL server. 

As this project had to be developed with manual SQL Queries, AutoCareSQL.sql file include all the queries to Create tables with necessary restraints, Insert data into tables, Update tables and SQL Queries for necessary reports for our system. 

For ease of only viewing SQL Queries, i will include a .md file with all SQL Queries. 

The whole project is documented and convered to .pdf file. For Confidential information matters, some front cover pages including private information were removed before uploading. 

Thank you!
